;; Assignment 6 - Automated Inference - Theorem Prover : Advanced
; The program implements a Propositional Logic Solver that accepts arbitrary propositional statements,
; converts them into CNF form and then performs resolution to answer propositional logic questions. The program 
; supports unary and binary operations only. The operands supported are : NOT, OR, AND, IMPLIES, BICONDITIONAL.
;
; The program returns #t if the negation of the premise resolves in a contradiction or UNKNOWN otherwise. 
; The program accepts the argument of the following forms :
; 	1. (OR a b), (OR a (OR b c)), (OR (OR a b) (OR b d)) - any unary/binary combination with any operator
; 	2. If single literal, it is passed without a list. Eg: (ask 'hasDog) and not (ask '(hasDog))
; 	3. Other inputs as described in the description
