;; Assignment 6 - Automated Inference - Theorem Prover : Basic 
;
; The assignment implements the resolution algorithm. It accepts two statements in their CNF form
; and returns their resolution, if it exists. The resolution algorithm works as follows :
;	1. Literal resolved with its own compliment gives a contradiction : (a) ^ (NOT a) = CONTRADICTION
;	2. If there are no pairs of complimentary literals between the two statements : returns #f -> (a b) ^ (c d)
;	3. If there are more than one pair of complimentary literals between the two statements : returns #f -> (a b) ((NOT a) (NOT b))
;	4. If there is exactly one pair of complimentary literals between the two statements : returns resolved clause -> (a b) ^ ((NOT a) c) = (b c)
;
; The function "resolve" accepts two lists (in same format as given in description) and returns the result.
